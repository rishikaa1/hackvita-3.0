 # Road Segmentation Demo

This project demonstrates road segmentation from aerial images using a custom U-Net model, deployed on Render with FastAPI.

## Live Demo
- **URL**: [https://road-segmentation.onrender.com](https://your-app.onrender.com)
- **Note**: Initial request may take ~30 seconds due to Renderâ€™s free-tier wake-up. Subsequent requests take 5-10 seconds.

## How to Use
1. Visit the URL above.
2. Upload an aerial image (JPG/PNG).
3. View the segmented road mask generated by U-Net.

## U-Net Baseline
- **Dice Coefficient**: [Insert post-training value, e.g., 0.85]
- **IoU**: [Insert post-training value, e.g., 0.78]
- **Inference Time on Render**: ~5-10 seconds
- **Why U-Net**: A staple in image segmentation, offering a lightweight, custom architecture ideal for initial testing.

## Technical Details
- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **Model**: Custom U-Net
- **Hosting**: Render (free tier)
- **Dataset**: Massachusetts Roads Dataset

## Next Steps
- Upgrade to DeepLabV3+ with MobileNetV2 for improved accuracy and faster inference.
